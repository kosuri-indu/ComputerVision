# Computer Vision

Computer Vision (CV) is a branch of Computer Science that empowers machines to see, recognize, and process images just like humans. It is a multidisciplinary field and could be called a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

- Understanding the content of digital images is the main objective of computer vision. This might seem easy, but it's not because computers are not the same as humans. 

- The computer vision algorithms used today are based on pattern recognition and typically rely on convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
- Computers are first trained on an enormous amount of visual data. 
- In this step, computers process images and label the various objects on them. They also find patterns in those objects. 
- As a result, the computer can accurately detect whether or not a particular image is a cat each time we send it pictures.

Some of the most popular applications include:

- **Object Classification**: Recognizing the broad category of an object in a photograph.
- **Object Identification**: Identifying the specific type of object in a photograph.
- **Object Detection**: Detecting the location of an object in a photograph.
- **Object Verification**: Verifying the presence of an object in a photograph.
- **Object Landmark Detection**: Detecting key points for an object in a photograph.
- **Object Segmentation**: Segmenting the pixels that belong to an object in an image.
- **Object Recognition**: Recognizing objects in a photograph and pinpointing their location.
